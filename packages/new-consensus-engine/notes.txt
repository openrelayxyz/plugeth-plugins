The test plugin 

Seperate out the consensus engine into its own seperate plugin. the test plugin will then become a seperate plugin that utilizes the same functionality. The stand alone consensus engine plugin will need some
sample functionality, perhaps and rpc call in order to demonstrate its capabilities. 

Create plugin_hook_test.go files in the plugin directories which will call out to the injections which arent already covered by the test.
